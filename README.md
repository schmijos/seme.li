# Semel Secure Message

Visit [seme.li](https://seme.li) to share expiring secrets once.
Encryption and decryption is done exclusively in the browser.
No secret reaches the server.

## Run your own

This is a _12factor_ app using the Apt and Crystal Heroku buildpacks.
Feel free to fork it and run it by yourself.
I'd be glad if you could bring back nice changes to this repo in a pull request.

> **Warning**
> Be aware though that you'll
[loose your SQLite database often](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#ephemeral-filesystem)
if you use Heroku. You may want to hook into a Postgres database
or use [Dokku with a volume](https://dokku.com/docs/advanced-usage/persistent-storage/)
on your own server.
Sticking to a SQLite database also means that you can run on 1 "dyno" only.

## Development

Install required prerequisites:

* Crystal >=1.1
* SQLite3
* [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)

Then run those convenient scripts from the project root:

```sh
bin/setup
bin/check
bin/run
```

## FAQ

* **Why is there no file upload support?**

  File upload capabilities would increase demands for the backend and complexity in general.
  The idea is rather that you encrypt a file and send it through an insecure channel.
  You would then only share the encryption key via [seme.li](https://seme.li).
  
  If you really want file upload support, you can add it yourself.
  Have a look at [this PR](https://github.com/schmijos/seme.li/pull/3).

  Alternatively I know about the following more bloated (less auditable) alternatives.
  They all support file uploads:
  * [wormhole.app](https://wormhole.app/)
  * [hemmelig.app](https://hemmelig.app)
  * [transferly.swiss](https://www.transferly.swiss/)

* **How should I encrypt a file to be transferred on an insecure channel?**

  You can use OpenSSL tooling like this

  ```sh
  openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -pbkdf2 -iter 20000 -in folder.zip -out folder.zip.enc
  ```
  
  The resulting (big) file `folder.zip.enc` would be transferred on an insecure channel
  like email together with the instruction to decrypt the file while the password
  goes over seme.li.
  
  Use this to decrypt the file
  
  ```sh
  openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -salt -pbkdf2 -iter 20000 -in folder.zip.enc -out folder.zip
  ```
  
  **Attention:** Normal ZIP encryption is not secure and can be broken by a script kiddie
  in a matter of seconds. The above used OpenSSL approach is way better.
